THA Hooks Interface follows Theme Hook Alliance to allow child theme authors to easily customize and alter theme functionality from within dashboard.

== Description ==

THA Hooks Interface is a WordPress plugin developed by ThematoSoup. It creates a settings page which allows you to add code (PHP and HTML) by using hooks defined by the Theme Hook Alliance.

Core WordPress offers a suite of action hooks and template tags, but does not cover many of the common use cases. The Theme Hook Alliance is a community-driven effort to agree on a set of third-party action hooks that THA themes pledge to implement in order to give desired consistency.

THA Hooks Interface checks whether a theme uses these standardized hooks and if it does, it creates an interface where you can add code to almost any part of the theme.
